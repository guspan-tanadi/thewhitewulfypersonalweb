## My Portfolio

### Hey there! If you are reading this then you are looking at repository of my portfolio website.

I am Alok Prateek, a computer science student and freelancer from Delhi, India.

I am interested in front-end design, I like the ways in which visual aids elegantly help to convey a message across the audience.
For this site I've used static content to demonstrate my experiments with these technologies.

I've designed the site in three parts:
	*The main portfolio page:* this was built using HTML5 and JS
	*The experiments:* These are mostly css and js based which I designed over many years, some for competitions and some for fun.
	*CV:* The CV page is designed using CSS grid and is printer friendly, i.e. it will print as you would have made it Ms-word or similar.
	*Graphic Design:* This part contains all the graphic design work that I've done over the years, and isn't bound by any client copyright.
	*Blog:* I do have a blog, where I intend to collect all my written work and write often, but it is mostly blank because I prefer writing code for clients, than well, my blog. I intend to change this habit. But again it has only been in intentions. :-/
